Installation
============

Once the requirements are fulfilled, you are ready to install Akeneo PIM. Otherwise, check the *Setup System Requirements* pages.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   system_requirements/system_requirements
   installation_ce_archive
   installation_ee_archive
   setup_hybrid_storage_mysql_mongo

Here are the guidelines to set everything up according to your operating system:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   system_requirements/system_install_ubuntu_1404
   system_requirements/system_install_ubuntu_1604
   system_requirements/system_install_debian8
   system_requirements/system_install_debian8_php7

Alternatively, you can choose to setup your install of Akeneo PIM through Docker.
In this case, you can just ignore the previous system requirements and installation procedures and follow the following guide:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   docker/installation_docker
